Headlong into the dark.
We listen closely to find our calling.
Each new day urges us to find a way to separate.
Don't let your vagabond shoes carry you too far away.
The road is unending.
Our paths will converge again.
I hope this letter I'm sending, finds you out.

It's been said,
That the pen is mightier than the sword.
And closures my weapon of choice.
So beware of the miles that lie between.
Sincerely,
From Jersey.

How have you been, it's been so long.
Hope your daily grinds not too much to bear.
So here we are.
Who would've thought it?
It's like millions of miles away, from you.
The road is unending.
Our paths will converge again.
I hope this letter I'm sending, finds you out.

It's been said,
That the pen is mightier than the sword.
And closures my weapon of choice.
So beware of the miles that lie between.
Sincerely,
From Jersey.

Recounting, faded memories.
Gives you for them in my mind.
When I was out there, reaching for my dreams.
I kept you with me all the time.
You were with me all the time.

It's been said,
That the pen is mightier than the sword.
And closures my weapon of choice.
So beware of the miles that lie between.
Sincerely,
From Jersey.
