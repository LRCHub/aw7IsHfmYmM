I am a lesson you learned
I am a hope that is free
Give yourself to me
I am all that you love but just like the daughters of Eve
You're like bitter fruit from forbidden trees and
Don't be scared I'm only trying to help you
It's easy to get cut down to size when you see through
Uninspired
I'm safely out of range of all the games that you play
And I'm so tired
Of everything you say
I'm not something you ate
I am a truth that you hate
I am a weapon of choice
And I choose to use my voice
I'm like a fatal disease
I sneak inside and I leave
You feeling pitiful and weak in the knees
Don't be scared this will only hurt a little
Did you expect me to be soft?
Uninspired
I'm safely out of range
Of all the games that you play
And I am so tired
Of everything you say
I'm not something you ate
Uninspired
I'm safely out of range
Of all the games that you play
And I'm so tired
Of everything you say
I'm not something you ate
Uninspired we're safe now, we're safe now
And I'm on guard against anything you say
I'm not something you ate
